# IBM-capstone-Kyiv
Ukrainian people love to drink coffee. Especially those ones who live in big cities like Kyiv and used to work in the offices.  Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine, the multimillion city and the competition in the market of HoReCa is very tense. In addition to “traditional” restaurants and cafés that serve all kinds of coffee, there are so-called “moving coffee points” (automobiles redesigned to operate as cafés and equipped with professional coffee machines). My friend is intended to open a small new brick&amp;wall café. And I aim this research to find the best place for him to settle his new business.
